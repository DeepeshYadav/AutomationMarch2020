ITERATOR :

An iterator is an object that contains a countable number of values.
An iterator is an object that can be iterated upon, meaning that you
can traverse through all the values.
Technically, in Python, an iterator is an object which implements
the iterator protocol,
which consist of the methods __iter__() and __next__().

CLOSURE :

The criteria that must be met to create closure in Python are
summarized in the following points.

1. We must have a nested function (function inside a function).
2. The nested function must refer to a value defined in the enclosing function.
3. The enclosing function must return the nested function.
